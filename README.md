# Project charter

The fast-paced nature of online news delivery and social media means that readers today regularly ingest news headlines without meaningful context. This app offers an alternative way to understand the news by providing context through Wikipedia articles.

## Vision

To display daily news content and suggest Wikipedia articles that are relevant to them. Users can read the news in a way is engaging and interactive, but with minimal bias and misinformation.

## Mission

The headlines and news descriptions will come from one or more news APIs. Spacy's pretrained [Named Entity Recognition](https://spacy.io/api/entityrecognizer) (NER) tool can be used to extract names, organizations, locations, phrases, etc. from a news description. The resulting entities/topics can then be used to query wikipedia pages using the wikipedia API.

Given a search query, the Wikipedia API can return the most relevant articles. 

For example, here is an April 4th headline: `"GMC's newly-unveiled Hummer EV SUV is 830HP of electric 'supertruck'"`. Using NER entities to search Wikipedia, these articles are suggested (most recent revision times are also shown).

```
GMC (automobile)
2021-04-02T00:03:08Z

GMC Hummer EV
2021-04-04T00:38:23Z

HP EliteBook
2021-03-09T14:43:09Z
```

The first two articles are relevant, but the third is not. Irrelevant articles can be removed if they fail to meet a similarity metric threshhold.

- [News API](https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?)
- [Wikipedia API](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php)
- [Python wrapper for Wikipedia API](https://github.com/goldsmith/Wikipedia)

## Success criteria

**Prediction metric:**

After searching Wikipedia for the topic(s), the app should identify whether the top result is relevant to the news article. 

A number of similarity metrics, along with text cleaning, can be tested before determining the optimal metric and threshhold. For example, using python's built-in `SequenceMatcher`, these two texts have a similarity score of 0.08. 

from News API:

>"GMC just unveiled its $100,000 Hummer EV SUV with 830-horsepower that will hit streets in 2023 (GM). The Hummer EV pickup won\'t be the only "supertruck" in GMC\'s fleet after the automaker unveiled its Hummer EV SUV variant on Saturday. It\'s slated for release in spring 2023."

from Wikipedia's page "GMC Hummer EV":

>"The GMC Hummer EV is both an upcoming off-road luxury electric vehicle produced by GMC (simply referred to as Hummer EV; and badged as HEV), and its own sub-brand. The Hummer EV line was launched in October 2020 through a live stream.\nThe Hummer EV sub-brand includes a pickup truck (SUT) and a confirmed Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) that was introduced on 3rd of April 2021."

**Business outcome:**

Ideally the deployed app would track whether a user clicks on the Wikipedia articles that are linked. Business success can be measured based on a ratio of the number of internal link clicks versus overall visits to the web app. This is possible to measure but outside the scope of the project.

## Running the app
### 1. Initialize the database 

#### Create the database 
To create the database in the location configured in `config.py` run: 

`python run.py create_db --engine_string=<engine_string>`

By default, `python run.py create_db` creates a database at `sqlite:///data/tracks.db`.

#### Adding songs 
To add songs to the database:

`python run.py ingest --engine_string=<engine_string> --artist=<ARTIST> --title=<TITLE> --album=<ALBUM>`

By default, `python run.py ingest` adds *Minor Cause* by Emancipator to the SQLite database located in `sqlite:///data/tracks.db`.

#### Defining your engine string 
A SQLAlchemy database connection is defined by a string with the following format:

`dialect+driver://username:password@host:port/database`

The `+dialect` is optional and if not provided, a default is used. For a more detailed description of what `dialect` and `driver` are and how a connection is made, you can see the documentation [here](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/13/core/engines.html). We will cover SQLAlchemy and connection strings in the SQLAlchemy lab session on 
##### Local SQLite database 

A local SQLite database can be created for development and local testing. It does not require a username or password and replaces the host and port with the path to the database file: 

```python
engine_string='sqlite:///data/tracks.db'

```

The three `///` denote that it is a relative path to where the code is being run (which is from the root of this directory).

You can also define the absolute path with four `////`, for example:

```python
engine_string = 'sqlite://///Users/cmawer/Repos/2020-MSIA423-template-repository/data/tracks.db'
```


### 2. Configure Flask app 

`config/flaskconfig.py` holds the configurations for the Flask app. It includes the following configurations:

```python
DEBUG = True  # Keep True for debugging, change to False when moving to production 
LOGGING_CONFIG = "config/logging/local.conf"  # Path to file that configures Python logger
HOST = "0.0.0.0" # the host that is running the app. 0.0.0.0 when running locally 
PORT = 5000  # What port to expose app on. Must be the same as the port exposed in app/Dockerfile 
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///data/tracks.db'  # URI (engine string) for database that contains tracks
APP_NAME = "penny-lane"
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = True 
SQLALCHEMY_ECHO = False  # If true, SQL for queries made will be printed
MAX_ROWS_SHOW = 100 # Limits the number of rows returned from the database 
```

### 3. Run the Flask app 

To run the Flask app, run: 

```bash
python app.py
```

You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

## Running the app in Docker 

### 1. Build the image 

The Dockerfile for running the flask app is in the `app/` folder. To build the image, run from this directory (the root of the repo): 

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile -t pennylane .
```

This command builds the Docker image, with the tag `pennylane`, based on the instructions in `app/Dockerfile` and the files existing in this directory.
 
### 2. Run the container 

To run the app, run from this directory: 

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name test pennylane
```
You should now be able to access the app at http://0.0.0.0:5000/ in your browser.

This command runs the `pennylane` image as a container named `test` and forwards the port 5000 from container to your laptop so that you can access the flask app exposed through that port. 

If `PORT` in `config/flaskconfig.py` is changed, this port should be changed accordingly (as should the `EXPOSE 5000` line in `app/Dockerfile`)

### 3. Kill the container 

Once finished with the app, you will need to kill the container. To do so: 

```bash
docker kill test 
```

where `test` is the name given in the `docker run` command.

### Example using `python3` as an entry point

We have included another example of a Dockerfile, `app/Dockerfile_python` that has `python3` as the entry point such that when you run the image as a container, the command `python3` is run, followed by the arguments given in the `docker run` command after the image name. 

To build this image: 

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile_python -t pennylane .
```

then run the `docker run` command: 

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 --name test pennylane app.py
```

The new image defines the entry point command as `python3`. Building the sample PennyLane image this way will require initializing the database prior to building the image so that it is copied over, rather than created when the container is run. Therefore, please **do the step [Create the database with a single song](#create-the-database-with-a-single-song) above before building the image**.

# Testing

From within the Docker container, the following command should work to run unit tests when run from the root of the repository: 

```bash
python -m pytest
``` 

Using Docker, run the following, if the image has not been built yet:

```bash
 docker build -f app/Dockerfile_python -t pennylane .
```

To run the tests, run: 

```bash
 docker run penny -m pytest
```
